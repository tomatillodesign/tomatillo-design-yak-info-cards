A custom Gutenberg block that displays flexible, ACF-powered info cards in a grid/deck layout. Designed for WordPress themes built with Yak or Tomatillo Design tools.

== Description ==

**Yak Card Deck** provides a custom "Info Cards" block built with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF PRO) to display visually consistent content cards. Ideal for showcasing team members, locations, features, or service offerings in a responsive deck-style grid.

The block is registered via ACF's `acf_register_block_type()` API, and comes with pre-styled templates and a working `block.json` configuration. Styles are included and scoped for the block. ACF fields are bundled directly within the plugin.

== Features ==

- Responsive card layout using full-width `align: full`
- Custom card styling via CSS
- Flexible ACF-based card content
- Supports:
  - Display-only cards
  - Linked cards
  - Modal pop-ups
  - Expandable/collapsible cards
- Works with images, icons, titles, descriptions, and custom fields
